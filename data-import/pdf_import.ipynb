Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text.\\n1.3 Chapter review\\nThe plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice.\\n1.3.1 Summary\\n1.3.2 Terms\\nAn experiment is designed to study the effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke\\n(Chimowitz et al. 2011). Stents are small mesh tubes that are placed inside narrow or weak arteries to 1.4 Exercises\\nassist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death.\\nView source \\uf09b\\nMany doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by\\nEdit this page \\uf09b\\nwriting the principal question the researchers hope to answer:\\nDoes the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?\\nThe researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. Each\\nvolunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:\\nTreatment group. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The\\nmedical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle\\nmodification.\\nControl group. Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the\\ntreatment group, but they did not receive stents.\\nResearchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In\\nthis study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical\\nimpact of stents in the treatment group.\\nResearchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after\\nenrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in Table 1.1. Patient outcomes are recorded as\\nor , representing whether the patient had a stroke during that time period.\\nstroke no event\\nThe data and data can be found in the openintro R package.\\nstent30 stent365\\npatient group 30 days 365 days\\n1 treatment no event no event\\n2 treatment stroke stroke\\n3 treatment no event no event\\n4 treatment no event no event\\n5 control no event no event\\nTable 1.1: Results for five patients from the stent study.It would be difficult to answer a question on the impact of stents on the occurrence of strokes for all\\nstudy patients using these individual observations. This question is better addressed by performing a\\nstatistical data analysis of all observations. Table 1.2 summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In\\nthis table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number\\nof patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days after the treatment, we look in the\\nleftmost column (30 days), at the intersection of treatment and stroke: 33. To identify the number of\\ncontrol patients who did not have a stroke after 365 days after receiving treatment, we look at the\\nrightmost column (365 days), at the intersection of control and no event: 199.\\n30 days 365 days\\nGroup Stroke No event Stroke No event\\nControl 13 214 28 199\\nTreatment 33 191 45 179\\nTotal 46 405 73 378\\nTable 1.2: Descriptive statistics for the stent study.\\nG\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\nOf the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first year. Using\\nthese two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a\\nstroke by the end of their first year. (Note: answers to all Guided Practice exercises are\\nprovided in footnotes!)3\\nWe can compute summary statistics from the table to give us a better idea of how the impact of the\\nstent treatment differed between the two groups. A summary statistic is a single number summarizing\\ndata from a sample. For instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two\\nsummary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.\\nProportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: 45/224 = 0.20 = 20%.\\nProportion who had a stroke in the control group: 28/227 = 0.12 = 12%.\\nThese two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a\\nsurprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two\\nreasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would reduce the rate of\\nstrokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a “real” difference between the\\ngroups?\\nThis second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads\\nin any given coin flip is 50%, we probably wonʼt observe exactly 50 heads. This type of variation is part\\nof almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is\\ndue to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size),\\nthe less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So, what we are really asking is the\\nfollowing: if in fact stents have no effect, how likely is it that we observe such a large difference?\\nWhile we do not yet have statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend\\nthe conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study\\nof stroke patients.\\nBe careful: Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at\\npatients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not\\nbe representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents, and this study only\\nconsidered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us\\nwith an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.1.2 Data basics\\nEffective presentation and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section introduces\\none structure for organizing data as well as some terminology that will be used throughout this book.\\n1.2.1 Observations, variables, and data matrices\\nTable 1.3 displays six rows of a dataset for 50 randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club,\\nwhich is a peer-to-peer lending company. This dataset will be referred to as .\\nloan50\\nThe data can be found in the openintro R package.\\nloan50\\nEach row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a case or observational\\nunit. The columns represent characteristics of each loan, where each column is referred to as a\\nvariable. For example, the first row represents a loan of $22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, where\\nthe borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of $59,000.\\nG\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\nWhat is the grade of the first loan in Table 1.3? And what is the home ownership status of the\\nborrower for that first loan? Reminder: for these Guided Practice questions, you can check\\nyour answer in the footnote.4\\nIn practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data\\nare understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and\\nits units of measurement. Descriptions of the variables in the dataset are given in Table 1.4.\\nloan50\\nloan_amount interest_rate term grade state total_income homeownership\\n1 22,000 10.90 60 B NJ 59,000 rent\\n2 6,000 9.92 36 B CA 60,000 rent\\n3 25,000 26.30 36 E SC 75,000 mortgage\\n4 6,000 9.92 36 B CA 75,000 rent\\n5 25,000 9.43 60 B OH 254,000 mortgage\\n6 6,400 9.92 36 B IN 67,000 mortgage\\nTable 1.3: Six observations from the dataset\\nloan50\\nVariable Description\\nloan_amount Amount of the loan received, in US dollars.\\ninterest_rate Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage.\\nterm The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of\\nmonths.\\ngrade Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents\\nthe quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid.\\nstate US state where the borrower resides.\\ntotal_income Borrowerʼs total income, including any second income, in US\\ndollars.\\nhomeownership Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or\\nrents.\\nTable 1.4: Variables and their descriptions for the dataset.\\nloan50The data in Table 1.3 represent a data frame, which is a convenient and common way to organize data,\\nespecially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. A data frame where each row is a unique case\\n(observational unit), each column is a variable, and each cell is a single value is commonly referred to as\\ntidy dataWickham (2014).\\nWhen recording data, use a tidy data frame unless you have a very good reason to use a different\\nstructure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns and\\nfacilitates visualization, summarization, and other statistical analyses.\\nG\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\nThe grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a\\ngradebook that takes the form of a data frame.

On the\\nother hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the\\naverage, sum, and difference of area codes does not have any clear meaning. Instead, we would\\nconsider area codes as a categorical variable.\\nThe variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than\\npop2017\\n. This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers\\nunemployment_rate\\n(0, 1, 2, …). For this reason, the population variable is said to be discrete since it can only take numerical\\nvalues with jumps. On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be continuous.\\nThe variable can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: AL, AK, …, and WY.\\nstate\\nBecause the responses themselves are categories, is called a categorical variable, and the\\nstate\\npossible values (states) are called the variableʼs levels (e.g., DC, AL, AK, etc.) .\\nFinally, consider the variable, which describes the median education level of county\\nmedian_edu\\nresidents and takes values , , , or in each county. This\\nbelow_hs hs_diploma some_college bachelors\\nvariable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable, but the levels have a natural ordering. A\\nvariable with these properties is called an ordinal variable, while a regular categorical variable without\\nthis type of special ordering is called a nominal variable. To simplify analyses, any categorical variable in\\nthis book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.\\nFigure 1.1: Breakdown of variables into their respective types.E\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765:\\nData were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for\\neach student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously\\ntaken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete\\nnumerical, or categorical.\\nThe number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the\\nnumber of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous\\nnumerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories – those who have\\nand those who have not taken a statistics course – which makes this variable categorical.\\nG\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\nAn experiment is evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug in treating migraines. A\\ngroup\\nvariable is used to indicate the experiment group for each patient: treatment or control. The\\nvariable represents the number of migraines the patient experienced during\\nnum_migraines\\na 3-month period. Classify each variable as either numerical or categorical?7\\n1.2.3 Relationships between variables\\nMany analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A\\nsocial scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:\\nDoes a higher-than-average increase in county population tend to correspond to counties with\\nhigher or lower median household incomes?\\nIf homeownership in one county is lower than the national average, will the percent of housing units\\nthat are in multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national average?\\nHow much can the median education level explain the median household income for counties in the\\nUS?\\nTo answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the dataset shown in Table 1.5.\\ncounty\\nExamining summary statistics can provide numerical insights about the specifics of each of these\\nquestions. Alternatively, graphs can be used to visually explore the data, potentially providing more\\ninsight than a summary statistic.\\nScatterplots are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables.\\nFigure 1.2 displays the relationship between the variables and , which is the\\nhomeownership multi_unit\\npercent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures (e.g., apartments, condos). Each point on the\\nplot represents a single county. For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the\\ndataset: Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of housing units that are in multi-\\ncounty\\nunit structures and a homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the\\ntwo variables: counties with a higher rate of housing units that are in multi-unit structures tend to have\\nlower homeownership rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each\\nidea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.Figure 1.2: A scatterplot of homeownership versus the percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures\\nfor US counties. The highlighted dot represents Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has a multi-unit rate of\\n39.4% and a homeownership rate of 31.3%.\\nThe multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible\\npattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called associated\\nvariables.\\nG\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765\\nExamine the variables in the dataset, which are described in Table 1.4. Create two\\nloan50\\nquestions about possible relationships between variables in that are of interest to\\nloan50\\nyou.8\\nE\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\uf765:\\nThis example examines the relationship between the percent change in population from 2010\\nto 2017 and median household income for counties, which is visualized as a scatterplot in\\nFigure 1.3. Are these variables associated?\\nThe larger the median household income for a county, the higher the population growth\\nobserved for the county. While it isnʼt true that every county with a higher median household\\nincome has a higher population growth, the trend in the plot is evident. Since there is some\\nrelationship between the variables, they are associated.Figure 1.3: A scatterplot showing population change against median household income. Owsley County of\\nKentucky is highlighted, which lost 3.63% of its population from 2010 to 2017 and had median household\\nincome of $22,736.\\nBecause there is a downward trend in Figure 1.2 – counties with more housing units that are in multi-unit\\nstructures are associated with lower homeownership – these variables are said to be negatively\\nassociated. A positive association is shown in the relationship between the and\\nmedian_hh_income\\nvariables in Figure 1.3, where counties with higher median household income tend to have\\npop_change\\nhigher rates of population growth.\\nIf two variables are not associated, then they are said to be independent. That is, two variables are\\nindependent if there is no evident relationship between the two.\\nAssociated or independent, not both.\\nA pair of variables are either related in some way (associated) or not (independent). No pair\\nof variables is both associated and independent.\\n1.2.4 Explanatory and response variables\\nWhen we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want to\\ndetermine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other. Consider the following rephrasing\\nof an earlier question about the dataset:\\ncounty\\nIf there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive an increase in its\\npopulation?\\nIn this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another. If this is our underlying belief, then\\nmedian household income is the explanatory variable, and the population change is the response\\nvariable in the hypothesized relationship.9\\nExplanatory and response variables.\\nWhen we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable the\\nexplanatory variable and the second the response variable. We also use the terms\\nexplanatory and response to describe variables where the response might be predicted\\nusing the explanatory even if there is no causal relationship.\\nexplanatory variable → might affect → response variableFor many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels would not\\nbe applied to either variable in such cases.\\nBear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to guarantee that a causal\\nrelationship exists. A formal evaluation to check whether one variable causes a change in another\\nrequires an experiment.\\n1.2.5 Observational studies and experiments\\nThere are two primary types of data collection: experiments and observational studies.\\nWhen researchers want to evaluate the effect of particular traits, treatments, or conditions, they\\nconduct an experiment. For instance, we may suspect drinking a high-calorie energy drink will improve\\nperformance in a race. To check if there really is a causal relationship between the explanatory variable\\n(whether the runner drank an energy drink or not) and the response variable (the race time), researchers\\nidentify a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are assigned a\\ntreatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a randomized\\nexperiment. Random assignment organizes the participants in a study into groups that are roughly\\nequal on all aspects, thus allowing us to control for any confounding variables that might affect the\\noutcome (e.g., fitness level, racing experience, etc.). For example, each runner in the experiment could\\nbe randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a\\nplacebo (fake treatment, in this case a no-calorie drink) and the second group receives the high-calorie\\nenergy drink. See the case study in Section 1.1 for another example of an experiment, though that study\\ndid not employ a placebo.\\nResearchers perform an observational study when they collect data in a way that does not directly\\ninterfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review\\nmedical or company records, or follow a cohort of many similar individuals to form hypotheses about\\nwhy certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data\\nthat arise. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association\\nbetween variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection as they do not offer a\\nmechanism for controlling for confounding variables.\\nAssociation ≠ Causation.\\nIn general, association does not imply causation. An advantage of a randomized experiment\\nis that it is easier to establish causal relationships with such a study. The main reason for this\\nis that observational studies do not control for confounding variables, and hence establishing\\ncausal relationships with observational studies requires advanced statistical methods (that\\nare beyond the scope of this book). We will revisit this idea when we discuss experiments\\nlater in the book.\\n1.3 Chapter review\\n1.3.1 Summary\\nThis chapter introduced you to the world of data. Data can be organized in many ways but tidy data,\\nwhere each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable, lends itself most\\neasily to statistical analysis. Many of the ideas from this chapter will be seen as we move on to doing full\\ndata analyses. In the next chapter youʼre going to learn about how we can design studies to collect the\\ndata we need to make conclusions with the desired scope of inference.1.3.2 Terms\\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter. If youʼre not sure what some of these terms mean, we\\nrecommend you go back in the text and review their definitions. We are purposefully presenting them in\\nalphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\\nHowever, you should be able to easily spot them as bolded text.\\nassociated experiment ordinal\\ncase explanatory variable placebo\\ncategorical independent positive association\\ncohort level randomized experiment\\ncontinuous negative association response variable\\ndata nominal summary statistic\\ndata frame numerical tidy data\\ndependent observational study variable\\ndiscrete observational unit\\n1.4 Exercises\\nAnswers to odd numbered exercises can be found in Appendix A.1.\\n\\x00.

In educational settings, gamification is often\\nimplemented as educational activities to solve problems by using characteristics of game elements.\\nResearchers investigating the effects of gamification on learning statistics conducted a study where\\nthey split college students in a statistics class into four groups: (1) no reading exercises and no\\ngamification, (2) reading exercises but no gamification, (3) gamification but no reading exercises,\\nand (4) gamification and reading exercises. Students in all groups also attended lectures. Students in\\nthe class were from two majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n = 279) and Business\\nAdministration (n = 86). After their assigned learning experience, each student took a final evaluation\\ncomprised of 30 multiple choice question and their score was measured as the number of questions\\nthey answered correctly. The researchers considered studentsʼ gender, level of studies (first throughfourth year) and academic major. Other variables considered were expertise in the English language\\nand use of personal computers and games, both of which were measured on a scale of 1 (beginner)\\nto 5 (proficient). The study found that gamification had a positive effect on student learning\\ncompared to traditional teaching methods involving lectures and reading exercises. They also found\\nthat the effect was larger for females and Engineering students. (Legaki et al. 2020)\\na. Identify the main research question of the study.\\nb. Who were the subjects in this study, and how many were included?\\nc. What are the variables in the study? Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. If\\nnumerical, state whether the variable is discrete or continuous. If categorical, state whether the\\nvariable is ordinal.\\n\\x00. Stealers, study components. In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and\\nunethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify\\nthemselves as having low or high social class by comparing themselves to others with the most\\n(least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented\\nwith a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby\\nlaboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After completing some unrelated tasks,\\nparticipants reported the number of candies they had taken. (Piff et al. 2012)\\na. Identify the main research question of the study.\\nb. Who were the subjects in this study, and how many were included?\\nc. The study found that students who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.\\nHow many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these\\nfindings? State the variables and their types.\\n\\x00. Migraine and acupuncture. A migraine is a particularly painful\\ntype of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with\\nacupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves\\nmigraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled\\nstudy where 89 individuals who identified as female diagnosed\\nwith migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two\\ngroups: treatment or control. Forty-three (43) patients in the\\ntreatment group received acupuncture that is specifically\\ndesigned to treat migraines. Forty-six (46) patients in the control\\ngroup received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-\\nacupoint locations). Twenty-four (24) hours after patients\\nreceived acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the\\ncontingency table below. Also provided is a figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate\\narea (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks.12 (Allais et al.\\n2011)\\nPain free?\\nGroup No Yes\\nControl 44 2\\nTreatment 33 10\\na.

Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all\\npeople who suffer from migraines. However, this is not the only possible conclusion. What is one\\nother possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that\\nare pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?\\ne. What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?\\n\\x00. Sinusitis and antibiotics. Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis\\ncompared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis\\nto one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of\\namoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of\\nsymptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day\\nperiod, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of\\nresponses is summarized below.13 (Garbutt et al. 2012)\\nImprovement\\nGroup No Yes\\nControl 16 65\\nTreatment 19 66\\na.

However, this is not the only possible conclusion.\\nWhat is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages\\npatients who experienced improvement in symptoms?\\ne. What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?\\n\\x00. Daycare fines, study components. Researchers tested the deterrence hypothesis which predicts\\nthat the introduction of a penalty will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject to the fine, with\\nthe condition that the fine leaves everything else unchanged by instituting a fine for late pickup at\\ndaycare centers. For this study, they worked with 10 volunteer daycare centers that did not originally\\nimpose a fine to parents for picking up their kids late. They randomly selected 6 of these daycare\\ncenters and instituted a monetary fine (of a considerable amount) for picking up children late and\\nthen removed it. In the remaining 4 daycare centers no fine was introduced. The study period was\\ndivided into four: before the fine (weeks 1–4), the first 4 weeks with the fine (weeks 5-8), the last 8\\nweeks with fine (weeks 9–16), and the after fine period (weeks 17-20). Throughout the study, the\\nnumber of kids who were picked up late was recorded each week for each daycare. The study found\\nthat the number of late-coming parents increased significantly when the fine was introduced, and no\\nreduction occurred after the fine was removed.14 (Gneezy and Rustichini
